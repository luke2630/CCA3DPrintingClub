# CCA3DPrintingClub

This is the github thing we will use to save all of our work. It shouldn't take too long and we should be done by this time next week considering the low requirements listed below

1. A profile on each of their members
2. Their past achievements
3. Their future goals
4. Covid updates

Therefore we will need
1. Index.html page to act as a homepage (Justin Liu & Luke Young)
2. an html page with the profiles (Hayden Zeng & Andrew Kang)
3. an html page with their covid updates and articles (Justin Liu & Kevin Xue)
4. an html page with projects (N/A)
5. a css page to make it not look like shit (Luke Young)
6. basic js to allow them to keep their donations page (Luke Young)
7. a place to credit us (probably just at the bottom in like a footer or something (Kevin Xue)
