# CCA3DPrintingClub

This is the github thing we will use to save all of our work. It shouldn't take too long and we should be done by this time next week considering the low requirements listed below

1. A profile on each of their members
2. Their past achievements
3. Their future goals
4. Covid updates

Therefore we will need
1. Index.html page to act as a homepage
2. an html page with the profiles
3. an html page with their covid updates and articles
4. an html page with projects
5. a css page to make it not look like shit
6. basic js to allow them to keep their donations page
7. a place to credit us (probably just at the bottom in like a footer or something)
